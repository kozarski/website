Welcome -

My head is usually occupied with ideas of efficiency, creativity, and curiosity. I love all things Web (HTML/CSS/JS), and I have a deep appreciation for thoughtful design. I'm a multimedia-centered individual (ex-skateboard photographer + videographer, now just a hobbyist), and I have a deep soft spot for cool hardware (Blackberry, I miss you).

Recently, I've been dedicating time to Motion Design: leveraging tools such as [Cinema 4D](https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d), [AE](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html), [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) and [Cavalry](https://cavalry.scenegroup.co). It's been incredibly rewarding combining my software engineering experiences with my passion for visual arts and kinetics. Beyond Motion, I'm often looking for opportunities to streamline parts of my life: whether that's through software, a new habit, or a new object. Oh, and I also enjoy personal finance.

My work background is broadly in software engineering, with various roles at [Square](https://square.com), [Facebook](https://www.meta.com) (aka "Meta"), [Venmo](https://www.venmo.com), [Apple](https://www.apple.com), and [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com).

So, what will you find here? Probably a mix of all the above. Expect posts about side projects, motion design experiments, photo/video showcases, thoughts on making tech more approachable, and ultimately anything else that is currently occupying my brain space.

Want to chat about any of this? You can reach me at my [email](mailto:coreykozarski@gmail.com).
